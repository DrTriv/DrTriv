- 👋 Hi, I’m @DrTriv (Dr Akash Trivedi), I am a Research Fellow & Tutor in Engineering at the University of Oxford
- 👀 I’m interested in applying computational/programming tools to solve interesting problems
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to translate my experiences in academia to the wider world. I'm also interested in learning more about web3, data science, ML/AI, CV and NLP
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on opportunities to apply the concepts mentioned above. Either to Materials Engineering (my PhD research area) or any other cool projects!
- 📫 How to reach me: www.linktr.ee/akash
- 🚀 My dream is to one day go into space!

Programming experiences:
- Matlab, Python, JavaScript (React, Node), Solidity, Hardhat

Recent projects:
- Currently documenting my project where I'm learning how to use ML techniques on python to predict how much a movie will take during its opening weekend.
    - Tools used: Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, BeautifulSoup)
- Created and deployed a smart contract and deployed a dApp allowing users to connect their wallet, wave and send a message for all to see (https://WaveApp.drtriv.repl.co)
    - Tools used: Solidity, Hardhat, JS, AlchemyAPI, Replit
- Created a DAO from scratch intended to be the home of researchers on web3 (https://researchdao.drtriv.repl.co/)
    - Deployed ERC-20 governance token/contract/treasury 
    - Deployed ERC-1155 NFT for people to mint to join the DAO
    - Built a dApp using JS on Replit allowing users to connect their wallet, mint an NFT, see DAO dashboard and actually vote on proposals executed automatically from the governance contract
    - Tools used: ThirdwebSDK, AlchemyAPI, Replit, JS, HTML, CSS

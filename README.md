- 👀 I’m interested in applying computational/programming tools to solve interesting problems
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to translate my experiences with Matlab into Python. I'm also interested in learning more about data science, ML/AI, CV and NLP
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on opportunities to apply the concepts I mentioned above to Materials Engineering. Also, any opportunity to apply these concepts to cool projects!
